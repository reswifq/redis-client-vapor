[![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/reswifq/redis-client-vapor/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/reswifq/redis-client-vapor)

Adapter to use [vapor/redis](https://github.com/vapor/redis) with [Reswifq](https://github.com/reswifq/reswifq).

## üèÅ Getting Started

#### Import VaporRedisClient into your project using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager):

``` swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourProject",
    products: [
      .executable(name: "YourProject", targets: ["YourProject"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/reswifq/redis-client-vapor", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.1.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
      .target(name: "YourProject", dependencies: ["VaporRedisClient"])
    ]
)
```

_**Note:** This will also import some [vapor/redis](https://github.com/vapor/redis) related packages into your project._

#### Create a client and a queue:

```
import Redis
import Reswifq
import VaporRedisClient

let client = VaporRedisClient(try TCPClient(hostname: "127.0.0.1", port: 6379))

let queue = Reswifq(client: client)
```

For more information on how to use [Reswifq](https://github.com/reswifq/reswifq) and the [vapor/redis](https://github.com/vapor/redis)' client, please refer to the related documentation.
